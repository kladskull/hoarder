#Hoarder
Hoarder is a deduplication-based backup system that supports compression and authenticated encryption. Hoarder shines when there are multiple servers being backed up, as it stores a single copy of a file and maps all duplicates to a single source.

##Why use this?
Well, you shouldn't yet. It is currently work-in-progress.

##What needs to be done?
1. Add the ability to upload the backup to a remote system (ssh? aws?).
2. Add the ability to restore from a backup server.
3. Write some unit tests.
4. Create test backup data.

##Words of Warning
This is in development and is not considered a full, or partial backup system yet.
